            <p>The key learning objectives for this simulation are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Be able to distinguish biased sources from authoritative sources in discussions about technology.
                </li>
                <li>Be able to identify poorly supported or opinionated statements regarding technology-based ethical issues.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a group, you and some other classmates have been assigned to write a position paper on information technology and ethics. Your group decides that each member will write a brief paragraph on a proposed topic and from those topics the group will determine which one will be developed into a full paper</p>
            <p>When you are presenting a position, you need to be careful to follow certain practices, like avoiding using opionions instead of verified facts.</p>
            <p>To help you construct the most persuasive argument, your instructor has posted a quick tutorial to remind you of the best techniques to use.</p>
